# Reactive-System-Tactics-RPG AKA Sleep Deprived
> This is the culmination of the work done by **Richard Chandler Thompson** and **Kaelan Hill** for Ludum Dare 48: Deeper and Deeper!
<br>
> Welcome to Sleep Deprived; a game about a quiet shepherd just trying to get a good nights rest for the first time in a little while. Unfortunately, sleep demons are haunting his dreams! Help him and his trusty (and absolutely adorable) sheep fight off the demons as the shepherd falls deeper and deeper into sleep... See what we did there? ;)
