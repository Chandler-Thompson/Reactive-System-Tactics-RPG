# Reactive-System-Tactics-RPG AKA Sleep Deprived
> This is the culmination of the work done by **Richard Chandler Thompson** and **Kaelan Hill** for Ludum Dare 48: Deeper and Deeper!
<br>
> Welcome to Sleep Deprived; a game about a quiet shepherd just trying to get a good nights rest for the first time in a little while. Unfortunately, sleep demons are haunting his dreams! Help him and his trusty (and absolutely adorable) sheep fight off the demons as the shepherd falls deeper and deeper into sleep... See what we did there? ;)

## Purpose

> We wanted to test out an idea we had for a game focusing on the interactability of different abilities, or as we called it a "reactive system." Thinking the best way to test out the idea, and get ourselves excited about it, was to do a game jam, we decided to join Ludum Dare 48.
> Obviously we had no idea what the theme would be, but we figured we could make something work, after all it was just a *theme* not *required gameplay fundamentals*!

## Gameplay

> You control a shepherd and his trusty flock of sheep who are trying to help the shepherd get a good night's rest despite the best efforts of the sleep demons...
> Each "stage of sleep", of which there are 5, is a battle against the sleep demons trying to drag you towards a restless night (on the right side of the board). 

?losing side?

> While your goal is to head where the grass is greener, for a wonderful rest with your fluffy companions!

?winning side?

> Don't worry too much if you can't fall asleep right away though, i.e. lose the first round. You still have a long night ahead, so try to make the most of it! Literally.. win the majority and you've slept well, however, lose a majority and well... we all know what that feels like the next morning.

?stages of sleep?

> Sadly the shepherd isn't much of a lucid dreamer, there is only so much he can do in his own dreams! He supports his sheep with buffs for them and debuffs for the sleep demons. And can even trade places with his sheep! 

?shepherd-sheep swap?

> The debuffs, that the shepherd casts, stack on the demons and it is the job of the sheep to pop the stacks. Pop enough stacks, and you get rid of a sleep demon, they even have a nice surprise inside! Oh, and don't be too worried about the sheep, their wool is surprisingly tank-like!
