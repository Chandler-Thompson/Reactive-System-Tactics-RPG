# Reactive-System-Tactics-RPG AKA Sleep Deprived
> This is the culmination of the work done by **Richard Chandler Thompson** and **Kaelan Hill** for Ludum Dare 48: Deeper and Deeper!

<br>

> Welcome to Sleep Deprived; a game about a quiet shepherd just trying to get a good nights rest for the first time in a little while. Unfortunately, sleep demons are haunting his dreams! Help him and his trusty (and absolutely adorable) sheep fight off the demons as the shepherd falls deeper and deeper into sleep... See what we did there? ;)

## Purpose

> We wanted to test out an idea we had for a game focusing on the interactability of different abilities, or as we called it a "reactive system." Thinking the best way to test out the idea, and get ourselves excited about it, was to do a game jam, we decided to join Ludum Dare 48.
> Obviously we had no idea what the theme would be, but we figured we could make something work, after all it was just a *theme* not *required gameplay fundamentals*!

## Gameplay

> You control a shepherd and his trusty flock of sheep who are trying to help the shepherd get a good night's rest despite the best efforts of the sleep demons...
> Each "stage of sleep", of which there are 5, is a battle against the sleep demons trying to drag you towards a restless night (on the right side of the board).

> Once the sleep demons have gotten their tentacles on you a few times, you're dragged towards it!

</p>

> While your goal is to head where the grass is greener, for a wonderful rest with your fluffy companions!

> They'll even take your place if you ask them nicely enough, aren't they swell?

> Don't worry too much if you can't fall asleep right away though, i.e. lose the first round. You still have a long night ahead, so try to make the most of it! Literally.. win the majority and you've slept well, however, lose a majority and well... we all know what that feels like the next morning.

> Sadly the shepherd isn't much of a lucid dreamer, there is only so much he can do in his own dreams.. He is fighting for his proverbial life against the sleep demons after all! He's busy doing what he can to debuff the demons, and then the sheep come along and take care of the rest.

</p>

> The debuffs, that the shepherd casts, stack on the demons and it is the job of the sheep to pop the stacks. Pop enough stacks, and you get rid of a sleep demon, they even have a cuddly surprise inside!

> Oh, and don't be too worried about the sheep, their wool is surprisingly tank-y! Sweet dreams!

## Tech and Thanks

- We wouldn’t have been able to get this far if it wasn’t for turn-based RPG tutorials by http://theliquidfire.com/projects/ upon which the base of our code is based, with our own modifications of course!
- For Audio I used the Royalty Free song “Reservoir Sunset (Remaster)” by Axletree https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Axletree#contact-artist, it was the *perfect* choice for ambience if we do say so ourselves!
- Of course, the Unity engine was pretty vital in our efforts here https://unity.com/
- And last, but most certainly not least, we have Ludum Dare to thank for putting on amazing game jams not just once, but Twice a year! https://ldjam.com
